# WordPress accessibility plugins

{: .alert }
Note that while many plugins in the WordPress plugin repository are overlays or widgets, none of those are listed here. The WordPress Accessibility team does not recommend the usage of [accessibility overlays](https://overlayfactsheet.com/en/).

## Editing Tools

- [Able Player for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ableplayer/). Able Player is a media player that offers extensive support for accessible features such as Audio Description, speed adjustment, and interactive transcriptions.
- [Accessibility New Window Warnings](https://wordpress.org/plugins/accessibility-new-window-warnings/).  Automatically adds visible warnings on all links that open in new tabs or windows
- [Screen Reader Text Format](https://wordpress.org/plugins/screen-reader-text-format/). Adds a block editor text control to set content as screen reader only.

## Plugin or Theme Specific Patterns

- [Contact Form 7: Accessible defaults](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7-accessible-defaults/) – generates accessible contact form defaults in Contact Form 7.

## General Purpose

- [WP Accessibility](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-accessibility/). Helps with a variety of common accessibility problems in WordPress themes. While most accessibility issues can’t be addressed without directly changing your theme, WP Accessibility adds a number of helpful accessibility features with a minimum amount of setup or expert knowledge.
