An inclusive website enhances your business. It will:

- **Increase Traffic**. More people can complete orders in your web shop.
- **Comply with the Law**. Your website is better prepared to adhere to your nation’s accessibility regulations and government contract requirements.
- **Improve SEO**. Google, the largest user of the internet, is blind and deaf.

The website you build is not for you, or even your client. It’s for the users. Increasing accessibility instantly gains you a larger potential user-base.

Entire countries are among this increased user-base: Israel, Norway and Australia require all company websites to be accessible. Many other nations have laws regarding website accessibility. The WAI provides an overview on [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/).

Another vital group of users with neither sight nor hearing are search engines. Improving accessibility improves your site’s Google visibility, thus improving your search engine optimization.
