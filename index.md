Please note: this website is work in progress and is still in the setup phase. Thes knowledge base has no content yet and the site needs an accessibility audit. Please visit, for now, the documentation on the [Make WordPress Accessible Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/).

This website wants to provide you with answers. How to design and create an accessible website or plugin, how to write accessible content and what is important to comply to legislation. With documentation, examples (do and don't) and reliable, up-to-date resources.
Next to this we are developing a pattern library with code example. We aim to meet [WCAG 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/).

Do you miss a topic, did you find an error or do you have a great idea? Create an issue on our [GitHub repository wpaccessibility/wp-a11y-docs](https://github.com/wpaccessibility/wp-a11y-docs/issues/).

We also would like to [invite you to contribute](/docs/contribute/) to this Knowledge Base.

Let's make the web for everyone.
