# Overlays

**TODO**: Add content:
- what is an overlay
- to consider: WP plugins for overlays and their claim (maybe not) 
- the difference between an overlay and a toolbar
- link to [overlayfactsheet.com](https://overlayfactsheet.com/en/)
- include video [Overlays Underwhelm](https://www.youtube.com/live/RDkqJaBwgKU?si=4K5oAYp0ttz7jmNj).
- add more resources from within the WP community
