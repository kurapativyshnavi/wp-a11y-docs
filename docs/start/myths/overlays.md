# Accessibility Overlays: A Comprehensive Overview

### What are Accessibility Overlays?

Accessibility overlays are third-party software widgets or plugins designed to be added to a website to address accessibility issues. Typically, these tools are marketed as a quick and inexpensive way to achieve legal compliance and make a website more accessible. They operate by injecting a layer of JavaScript code into a website, often appearing as a small, floating icon that, when activated, reveals a menu of options such as font adjustments, color contrast changes, or other visual settings.

### The Distinction Between Overlays and Toolbars

While both accessibility overlays and user preference toolbars may offer similar features, their underlying functionality and purpose are fundamentally different. Understanding this distinction is crucial for effective web accessibility.

* **Accessibility Overlays:** These are presented as a comprehensive solution to accessibility challenges. They are designed to act as a "fix" for a website's underlying code by attempting to automatically remediate accessibility issues on the fly. However, they frequently fail to correct fundamental problems with a site’s HTML, ARIA, or CSS. This approach can create new barriers for users of assistive technologies and often provides a false sense of compliance. An overlay is intended to fix the site for the user, but it cannot fix inaccessible source code.

* **User Preference Toolbars:** In contrast, toolbars are client-side applications that do not alter the website's original code. Their purpose is not to "fix" a site but to empower the end-user. They offer personal customization features, allowing individuals to modify their own browsing experience to suit their needs, such as adjusting text size or contrast. These tools are most effective when used on a website that is already built to be accessible, as they complement, rather than substitute for, proper accessibility practices.
