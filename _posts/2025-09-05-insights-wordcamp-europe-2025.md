In the beginning of June WordCamp Europe happened, the biggest WordPress event in the world where thought leaders, and industry experts share their insights and knowledge. Luckily, sessions from Tracks 1 and 2 are available on WordPress TV for everybody that missed the event, so you can always dive into the valuable insights at a later moment.

One topic that really stands out, especially when you are a European entrepreneur, is accessibility. With the European Accessibility Act (EAA) coming into effect in June, it's clear that this is something we all need to pay attention to. While the Act isn’t specific to WordPress, it affects all website owners, especially those running businesses online.

Three exceptional talks stand out this year that explore this topic from different angles:

- **Virginia’s Story**: She shared a deeply personal example, explaining why accessibility matters—not just in the digital world, but in all areas of life. She has firsthand experience with epilepsy and highlighted the importance of building more inclusive digital spaces.

- **Annelies’ Expert Insights**: As someone who works with agencies and businesses, Annelies broke down practical steps for implementing accessibility both for your website clients and your own company’s site.

You might be wondering, “Why should I care about accessibility? My audience doesn’t have any disabilities.” The answer is simple: accessibility benefits everybody.

Think about a ramp: it was originally designed for people in wheelchairs, but over time, it’s become something that’s used by so many others. Parents with strollers, travelers with suitcases, elderly people, or anyone dealing with temporary mobility issues also benefit from that ramp. 

The same principle applies to your website. By making it more accessible, you’re not just helping those with disabilities, you’re making it easier for everyone to use your site. Whether it’s people in a rush, those with temporary impairments, a bad internet connection, or anyone who finds traditional navigation cumbersome, accessibility features create a smoother experience for all users.

## Key takeaways

Here are the key takeaways from these sessions:

- **It’s About People**: The EAA is a set of regulations designed to improve the lives of real people. By prioritizing accessibility, you're not just making the world a better place, you're also expanding your customer base.
- **A Significant Need**: In the EU, 27% of people have a permanent disability, with even more experiencing temporary or situational disabilities. Can you imagine have a store and keeping 27% of your potential customers from coming in and buying something?
- **Non-Compliance is Widespread**: A staggering 96% of websites still fail to meet current accessibility standards. That means when your website is accessible the people that need it will have an extra reason to give you their money.
- **Learn by Doing**: You don’t need to get it perfect on your first try. The key is to start, make improvements along the way, and refine as you go.
- **Every Step Counts**: Small changes, made over time, will build momentum and lead to a more accessible site.
- **Document Your Progress**: If it’s not documented, it didn’t happen. Tracking your progress is crucial for maintaining focus and accountability.

## Action Steps

Short-term actions:
-  Using an accessible tool like WordPress is a great start. WordPress already has built-in features for accessibility. Don’t forget to check for accessible friendly themes and plugins.
-  Hire an expert to audit your website, software, and tools for accessibility.
-  Use tools like browser extensions to identify areas for improvement, you can find them by searching for ‘accessibility check’.
-  Involve your design, development, and content teams in the process to ensure a holistic approach.

Long-term actions:
-  Conduct a thorough inventory of your systems, software, website, and policies.
-  Seek legal advice to understand the specific requirements for your business.
-  Create an action plan, implement it, and regularly update your progress.
-  Assign a dedicated person to oversee the accessibility process.

## Final takeaway
While full compliance may not be required by the June 28, '25 deadline or for smaller companies, now is a great time to start. 

Track your progress and keep pushing forward. The more effort you put in, the more inclusive your website will become ultimately expanding your reach and growing your income.
