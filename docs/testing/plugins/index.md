# WordPress' plugins for accessibility testing 

{: .warning }
**TODO:**
Starter content. This content should be reviewed and restructured.
The links need to be checked and updated.

We do not specifically endorse any of the plugins listed here but offer them as tools for you to test and use in your own accessible WordPress site.
