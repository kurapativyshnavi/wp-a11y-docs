For web-based forms to be accessible to all devices, itâ€™s important to use valid, well-constructed HTML. Good structure is the foundation of a good form. In addition to using valid HTML, be sure to:

- Label controls (give `input` fields a `label`)
- Group controls with `fieldset` and `legend`
- Provide instructions to help users complete complex forms
- Validate user input
- Add accessible user notifications (both error and success messages)
- Do not remove native outline styling on `:focus` unless you provide custom styling that is equally prominent.
