> The text and structure is still dummy and placeholder text, just to show what the site can do, taken from the Just The Docs theme. This website still needs a proper a11y audit and has probably some a11y issues. Work in progress.

This test website is build Jekyll, using GitHub pages and GitHub actions.
Follow the [progress on GitHub](https://github.com/wpaccessibility/wp-a11y-docs).

The theme WP A11y Docs is based on [Just The Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/), and modified to make the site WCAG 2.2 AA accessible.
