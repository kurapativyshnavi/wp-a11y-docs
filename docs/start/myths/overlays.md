# Overlays

### What are Accessibility Overlays?

Accessibility overlays are third-party software applications or widgets that are added to a website to "fix" accessibility issues. They often appear as a small icon on the side of a page that, when clicked, opens a menu with options to change the font size, contrast, or other visual settings. These overlays typically use a single line of JavaScript code to load their functionality onto a site.

The companies that sell these products often market them as an easy, quick, and cheap way to achieve web accessibility compliance.

### The Difference Between an Overlay and a Toolbar

While both overlays and toolbars can offer users similar functions (like changing contrast or font size), they operate very differently.

* **Overlays** are sold as a one-click solution to accessibility. They inject code into a website and claim to automatically fix issues, but they can often introduce new problems and do not address the core accessibility of a site's code.
* **Toolbars** are client-side tools, meaning they don't change the underlying website code. Instead, they provide helpful functions for the end-user. For example, a toolbar might let a user change their cursor size, but it doesn't try to fix accessibility bugs in the site's HTML or CSS.
