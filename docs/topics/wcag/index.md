The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed guidelines to safeguard the accessibility of a website: the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines: WCAG. The current recommended version is 2.2.

For WordPress, we test against [WCAG version 2.2 level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/).

The page [Introduction to WCAG]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/start/wcag-intro/) explains how WCAG is put together and what all the terminology means, like principles, guidelines, succes criterion, techniques, levels and versions.

## Accessibility coding standards for WordPress core

Code integrated into the WordPress ecosystem – including WordPress core, WordPress.org websites, and official plugins, is expected to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), version 2.2, at level AA.

New or updated interfaces are encouraged to incorporate the [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/)(ATAG) 2.0.

More in the WordPress Coding Standards Handbook: [Accessibility Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/accessibility/).

## Accessibility statement for WordPress
[Accessibility statement for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/about/accessibility/).

Quoting:
> All new and updated code released in WordPress must conform with these guidelines as per the WordPress Accessibility Coding Standards. Some current features and functionality in development may not yet fully comply, and known issues are listed in the WordPress Trac “accessibility” focus.

> The WordPress accessibility coding standards require new or updated code to meet the standards of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.0 at level AA. ATAG conformance is an additional goal beyond WCAG compliance.

{: .alert }
WordPress is not currently conforming with ATAG 2.0, but pledges to pursue features that are accessible and which help users create accessible content in pursuit of the long-term goal of ATAG compliance.
