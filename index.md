# WP Accessibility Knowledge Base
{: .fs-9 }

Documentation about the accessibility of WordPress. For the community, by the community.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---
This test website is build Jekyll, using GitHub pages and GitHub actions. 
Follow the [progress in GitHub](https://github.com/rianrietveld/wp-a11y-docs).
The theme WP A11y Docs is based on [Just The Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/), and modified to make the site accessible (work in progress).

{: .warning }
> The text is dummy text, just to show what the site can do, taken from the Just The Docs theme. This website still has a11y issues, like missing screen reader feedback on the search option and the color contrast of code elements. Also, some styling needs to be improved on and the breadcrumbs are broken. Work in progress.


## Markdown kitchen sink
Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

{: .note }
We still need to examine and document the accessibility of the generated markdown features.

[Link to another page]({{site.baseurl}}/).

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

### More code

```python{% raw %}
def dump_args(func):
    "This decorator dumps out the arguments passed to a function before calling it"
    argnames = func.func_code.co_varnames[:func.func_code.co_argcount]
    fname = func.func_name
    def echo_func(*args,**kwargs):
        print fname, ":", ', '.join(
            '%s=%r' % entry
            for entry in zip(argnames,args) + kwargs.items())
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return echo_func

@dump_args
def f1(a,b,c):
    print a + b + c

f1(1, 2, 3)

def precondition(precondition, use_conditions=DEFAULT_ON):
    return conditions(precondition, None, use_conditions)

def postcondition(postcondition, use_conditions=DEFAULT_ON):
    return conditions(None, postcondition, use_conditions)

class conditions(object):
    __slots__ = ('__precondition', '__postcondition')

    def __init__(self, pre, post, use_conditions=DEFAULT_ON):
        if not use_conditions:
            pre, post = None, None

        self.__precondition  = pre
        self.__postcondition = post
{% endraw %}
```

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

### Collapsed Section

The following uses the [`<details>`](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-collapsed-sections) tag to create a collapsed section.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Shopping list (click me!)</summary>

This is content inside a `<details>` dropdown.

## About Just the docs

Just the Docs is a theme for generating static websites with [Jekyll]. You can write source files for your web pages using [Markdown], the [Liquid] templating language, and HTML.[^1] Jekyll builds your site by converting all files that have [front matter] to HTML. Your [Jekyll configuration] file determines which theme to use, and sets general parameters for your site, such as the URL of its home page.

Jekyll builds this Just the Docs theme docs website using the theme itself. These web pages show how your web pages will look *by default* when you use this theme. But you can easily *[customize]* the theme to make them look completely different!

Browse the docs to learn more about how to use this theme.

## Getting started

The [Just the Docs Template] provides the simplest, quickest, and easiest way to create a new website that uses the Just the Docs theme. To get started with creating a site, just click "[use the template]"!

{: .note }
To use the theme, you do ***not*** need to clone or fork the [Just the Docs repo]! You should do that only if you intend to browse the theme docs locally, contribute to the development of the theme, or develop a new theme based on Just the Docs.

You can easily set the site created by the template to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [template README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^2] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with the template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

{: .note }
See the theme [README][Just the Docs README] for how to use the theme as a gem without creating a new site.
