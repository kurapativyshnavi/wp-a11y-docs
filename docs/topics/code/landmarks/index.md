ARIA landmark roles provide a method for screen reader users to navigate structural regions of a site. By default, many HTML5 elements define ARIA landmark roles which identify these regions.

All content should be inside these semantically meaningful elements so content is not missed by the user.

## Most common landmark elements

<table>
    <caption>HTML5 sectioning elements</caption>
    <tr>
        <th>HTML5 element</th>
        <th>Default landmark role</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&lt;header&gt;</td>
        <td>banner</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&lt;nav&gt;</td>
        <td>navigation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&lt;main&gt;</td>
        <td>main</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&lt;aside&gt;</td>
        <td>complementary</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&lt;footer&gt;</td>
        <td>contentinfo</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Note that older browsers and assistive technology combinations don’t always recognize HTML5 elements and map them to the correct landmark role. In these cases you can add the role manually, like this: `<header role="banner">`. All browsers supported by WordPress Core support native  HTML5 elements.

More information can be found at the W3C [ARIA landmark example page](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20171214/examples/landmarks/index.html). You can also review the WordPress theme accessibility guidelines, as [WordPress themes are required to use landmark roles](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#aria-landmark-roles) in order to apply the accessibility-ready tag.

## Good example of HTML5 sectional elements

A basic example of page structure can look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Semantic HTML</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
  </head>
  <body>

    <header>
      <img src="logo.png" alt="We the people">
    </header>
  
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/home">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="/semantics">Semantics</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  
    <main>
      <article>
        <h1>Semantic HTML</h1>
        <p>That wasn’t so hard.</p>
      </article>
    </main>
  
    <aside>
      <p>Additional information.</p>
    </aside>
  
    <footer>
      <p>Information about the site.</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

Using this markup, screen reader users can navigate using mapped ARIA landmark roles. For example, in VoiceOver the landmark list will look like this:

![List of aria landmarks in VoiceOver: banner, navigation, main, complementary]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/aria-landmarks-in-voiceover.png)

Note that the contentinfo role is missing. This is because of a VoiceOver bug. Life isn’t perfect. You can add this role manually: `<footer role="contentinfo">`.

## Notes

If the same role appears on more than one element on a page, there should be an aria-label attribute on each of those elements. This will distinguish different landmarks. Navigation is the most common example:

`<nav aria-label="Top">`  
`<nav aria-label="Bottom">`

With those aria-label attributes, screen readers will announce **Top navigation** and **Bottom navigation**, rather than **navigation** and **navigation**.

![Top and bottom navigation added using aria labels]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/aria-landmarks-with-aria-label.png)

Note that the word navigation is already announced by assistive technologies. Therefore, avoid using landmark names like “navigation” in youraria-label content.

`<header>` and `<footer>` elements can also be inside other elements like `<article>`. But only elements which are direct descendants of the `<body>` tag will be exposed as `header`, `footer`, `banner` and `ContentInfo` landmarks respectively.
