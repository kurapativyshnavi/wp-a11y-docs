Documentation about accessibility for WordPress users and creators. For the community, by the community.

{: .alert }
**Please note**: this documentation is a work in progress.  
The content is not finished yet and the website needs an accessibility audit.

This documentation aims to provide you with answers about WordPress and accessibility. How do you design and create an accessible website or plugin? How do you write accessible content? What do you need to know to comply with international legislation? 

We'll provide documentation, effective examples (both what to do and what to avoid) and more reliable, up-to-date resources. Additionally, we are developing a pattern library with code examples. 

Did we miss a topic? Did you find an error or have a great idea? Please [share your thoughts](https://wpaccessibility.org/docs/contact/).

We would like to [invite you to contribute](/docs/contribute/) to this documentation. Let's make the web for everyone.
