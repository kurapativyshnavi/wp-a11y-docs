# How to contribute

Do you want to help maintaining and extending this website? 

{: .note }
Please note: we work with GitHub to maintain en extent the content of the knowledge base. Creating a GitHub account is free. If you want to contribute please choose Sign Up on the [GitHub homepage](https://github.com).

## Write or audit content for the knowledge base

From August 22, '25 we will publish topics to be written for the knowledge base [labeled documentation](https://github.com/wpaccessibility/wp-a11y-docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Adocumentation) in our GutHub repository.

You can also check the [WP A11y Docs project board](https://github.com/orgs/wpaccessibility/projects/3) and look through the issues in the **Todo** column.

We will write manuals on how to deliver that content:

- as a comment with the related GitHub issue.
- as a GitHub Pull Request on GitHub.
- as a GitHub Pull Request with a local install.

## Audit the accessibility of this website

A website about accessibility (a11y) must be accessible itself. That's a no-brainer. We want to meet WCAG 2.2 AA and do our very best to comply to that. We'd love to have full WCAG-EM audit of this website, to provide that information in our [accessibility statement](/docs/about/accessibility-statement/) and to fix the issues found. See: [Audit the website for accessibility WCAG 2.2 AA](https://github.com/wpaccessibility/wp-a11y-docs/issues/4).

Did you notice an a11y-issue on this website? Please inform us by opening an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/wpaccessibility/wp-a11y-docs/issues).

{: .note }
Please note: this is only for accessibility issues in **this website** and not for WordPress itself. If you find an accessibility issue in WordPress core, or in one of the core themes, please create a [new ticket on Make WordPress Core](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket) and give it the focus “accessibility”.

### Contribute with regular accessibility audits

Are you an accessibility expert or does your company perform audits? We would value audits of this website on a regular basis, to find all issues, so we can work on them.
Like one full WCAG-EM audit for WCAG 2.2 AA to start and a yearly audit on the new content and functionality. 

Your name or your company name will be added to the sponsor list. [Contact Rian Rietveld](https://rianrietveld.com/contact-rian-rietveld/) if you want to sponsor this project with a11y audits of wpaccessibility.org.


## Improve this website

WPaccessibility.org is written in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator in Ruby using [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for content. A website is never finished and there is always one more bug. If you want to help improve this website, please check out the issues in GitHub [labeled website](https://github.com/wpaccessibility/wp-a11y-docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Awebsite).
