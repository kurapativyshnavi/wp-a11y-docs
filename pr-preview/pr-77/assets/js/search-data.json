    "content": "This Jekyll theme WP A11y Docs is based on Just the Docs by Just The Docs is licenced as MIT. In this initial release the theme is renamed into WP A11y Docs. The URL for the GitHib pages is wpaccessibility.org. File organisation . This will be a one design theme only, so all the changes will be done directly in the files itself. This simplifies the code and makes the theme better maintainable. For this the following changes were made: . | Removed custom files and their references. | Removed redundant include files. | Removed the nav-footer: took up too much space and added a second &lt;footer&gt;. | Added option for posts and post pagination. | Refactored the breadcrumbs for the posts. | Removed Just the Docs info pages and create placeholder text to match the actual site structure. | Set Ruby to 3.3.6. | Added option to add a canonical URL. | . SCSS . | Refactoring directory structure. | Removed the dark theme for now, that will be restored when the theme is finished and stable. | Replaced @import for @use, for compatibility with Dart Sass 3.0.0. | Replaced darken by color.scale and color.adjust, for compatibility with Dart Sass 3.0.0. | Replaced deprecated global built-in functions by Sass values (sass:map, sass:color, sass:list etc.). | . CSS color contrast issue . | Placeholder: fixt color contrast and opacity. | Fixed color contrast issues for text and non-text meaningful elements. | . Search at the top of the page . | Refactored the HTML of the form to make the HTML valid. | Added screen reader feedback to announce number of search results. | . _config.yml . | Removed Google Analytics Tracking settings. | Removed most variable because this is a static site. | Changed names and colours of the callouts to match those used in WordPress documentation style guide | . Accessibility improvements . | Moved the button to expand the submenus to after the submenu link, so the tab order is meaningful. | Changed aria-pressed by aria-expanded, see also issue Change aria-pressed into aria-expanded for buttons connected to expandable content. | Added aria-current=\"page\" to links to the current page. | Removed anchor links before headings. The link was inside the heading, resulting in announcing the heading text twice. Maybe we find an accessible way later on. | Copy code button is now always visible (not only on hover) and has a larger clickable area. The copy action has now also screenreader feedback. | The code blocks now have a tabindex=”0”. | . ",

You need to run checks on a working WordPress site. This can be done using automation that sets up your environment dynamically, but still requires a fully built and run installation. There are several command line tools for automated testing like aXe-cli and pa11y. Automated accessibility testing doesn’t catch all the issues, rarely more than 30%. Testing in the browser and manual keyboard testing still needs to be part of your workflow. Setup for aXe-cli . Install axe-core for CLI first: . npm install axe-cli -g npm install chromedriver –g` . Then run axe in the command line: . axe url -b c . The url can be any url, also a local one. You get a report of the accessibility issues for that url. The -b stands for browser, c for chrome, as this browser gives the best results (better than the default PhantomJS). You will get the errors and warnings in your console. You can provide more (space separated) urls to the command like . axe url url2 url3 -b c . or call a file with urls like: . axe $( cat list-of-urls.txt ) -b c . Note: You can run axe-cli on more than one url in one command, but axe-cli is not build to run on a large amount of urls or on a complete site, axe-cli is not a crawler. Deque Labs recommends to use the axe-webdriverjs, a chainable aXe API for Selenium’s WebDriverJS for testing on a large amounts of urls. Setup for pa11y .
